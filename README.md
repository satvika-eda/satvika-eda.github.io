System and method for implementing a platform and language agnostic smart SDK upgrade module
Patent number: 12223309
Abstract: Various methods, apparatuses/systems, and media for automatically upgrading an application are disclosed. A processor creates a dynamic machine learning (ML) model; trains the dynamic ML model and scans for SDK upgrade for the application against the dynamic ML model by implementing ML algorithm for predictions. The processor executes the SDK upgrade in response to detecting that the training of the dynamic ML model is completed to trigger the processor to perform the following automated processes: implement the ML algorithm against the trained dynamic ML model to generate predictive results data for deprecated reference corresponding to the application; evaluate the predictive results data to determine whether there is a match for the deprecated reference; and when it is determined that there is a match for the deprecated reference, automatically replace code and upgrade the application to newer version of the programming language 
specification.
